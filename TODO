LibAiff 4.99
=====================================
This is a beta (CVS) version of LibAiff.

To-do-list:
	* Implementing <comments> for each <marker>
	  (with timestamp, etc.).
	  
	* A more intense beta-testing, specially on little-endian
	  platforms (AIFF is a big-endian format).
	  Some LibAiff features were tested only on big-endian,
	  although they should work well on little-endian there may
	  be some bugs...

        * Beta-testing on AIFC files.

	* Implementing some compression formats for AIFC
		[*] u-Law implemented as of 2.99.
		    Needs more testing.
		[*] A-Law implemented as of 2.99.
		    Needs more testing.
