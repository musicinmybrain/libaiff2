LibAiff 2.0
=====================================
This is a beta version of LibAiff.
It doesn`t support yet all the
AIFF features:

To-do-list:
	* Implementing <comments> for each <marker>
	  (with timestamp, etc.).
	  
	* A more intense beta-testing, specially on little-endian
	  platforms (AIFF is a big-endian format).
	  Some LibAiff features were tested only on big-endian,
	  although they should work well on little-endian there may
	  be some bugs...

        * Beta-testing on AIFC files.

	* Implementing some compression formats for AIFC
	  files, like u-Law, a-Law, etc.

Any comments? Want to help with this project?

	Thanks :)
