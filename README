1. Compilation and installation of LibAiff
		
		The default prefix for LIBAIFF installation
		is `/usr/local'. Prefix means that libraries
		will be installed on the lib/ subdirectory,
		includes on the include/ subdirectory and 
		so on.

		You can chose a different prefix with the 
		`--prefix' option of the configuration 
		script.
		Use `./configure --help' for more details.

		In the following examples, `%' means the 
		shell prompt for a normal system user, 
		and `#' means the shell prompt for a 
		privileged user capable of writing to the
		selected prefix.

	% ./configure
	% make
	# make install

		LibAiff will be installed as a `static library'.

	1.1. Installating the documentation
		
		While the default installation script does not 
		do so, it is advisable to copy the 
		provided documentation to a system-wide 
		directory such as share/doc/libaiff/:

	# cp MANUAL* /usr/local/share/doc/libaiff/


2. Using the library

		Please refer to the provided documentation,
		available in different formats:

	MANUAL: ASCII text/plain version
	MANUAL.html: HTML text/html ISO-8859-1 version

3. Reporting bugs, submitting patches, etc.
